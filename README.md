# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This is the back-end portion of the WTWR project, a comprehensive application designed to assist users in selecting suitable attire based on real-time weather conditions. It serves as the foundation for the application, handling data storage, retrieval, and processing. It leverages robust technologies to ensure efficient and reliable performance.

By integrating with a weather API, the backend fetches up-to-date weather information and uses it to recommend appropriate clothing options. It also provides features for user management, clothing item management, and a liking system, enhancing the overall user experience.

# Key Features:

- ✅ **User Management**: Manages user accounts, including creation, retrieval, and updates.

- 👗 **Clothing Item Management**: Creates, retrieves, and deletes clothing items.

- 👍 **Likes Functionality**: Allows users to like or unlike clothing items.

- 🚫 **Error Handling**: Provides informative error messages and handles exceptions gracefully.

- 🧪 **Testing**: Ensures code quality and reliability through automated testing.

# Technologies Used:

- ⚡️ **Express.js**: Leverages component-based architecture for efficient development.

- 🐘 **Mongoose**: Interacts with MongoDB databases to store and retrieve data.

- 🔎 **ESLint**: Enforces code quality and consistency using linting rules.

- 💅 **Prettier**: Automates code formatting to maintain a consistent style.

- 📝 **Validator**: Validates user input to ensure data integrity.

- 💻 **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core language used in the project.

I plan on next implementing user authentication and authorization security features to allow for secure user creation and logins.
